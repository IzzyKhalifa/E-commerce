# E-designs
The webpage is a E-commerce webpage for the user to buy/sell different products it's so open ended there isn't any limitations on what you can buy/sell on the website. You can place all your products in the shopping cart and proceed to checkout at anytime. As for now you can't add products but I'm working on the future developments as in giving products ratings and reviews too. This repo is for the front-end of the webpage there is a link provided at the bottom for the back-end repo.
## User Story 

```md
AS A new user of the e-commerce website, I want to be able to create an account.

WHEN browsing the products page, I want the option to add items to my shopping cart so I can keep track of the items I want to purchase.

ONCE I have all the items I want in my cart, I want to be able to proceed to checkout.

Overall, I expect a smooth and seamless user experience when shopping on the e-commerce website, with the ability to sign up, log in, add items to my cart, and checkout with ease.
